## Info

This directory hosts all the examples / starter code for the classes. New examples will be added regularly so you might have to pull it or sync it later on... 

We are mainly going to use 2 lib: ML5.js + TF.js which are included as submodules. If the submodules haven't been initialised please init them 'manually' using:

```
git submodule update --init
```
